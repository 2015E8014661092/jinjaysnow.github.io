# Question
Richard Stallman, the founder of the GNU Project, supports “free” software and believes that
proprietary software (like Microsoft Windows) is harmful. Do you agree with his views? In your
editorial, please include answers to the following questions. For questions that ask for your opinion,
please explain your reasoning.

- What is the free software movement? What does Richard Stallman mean by “free”? Does he
mean that people should not charge money for software, or does “free” have a different
meaning?
- What are the four essential freedoms of free software?
- What is the difference between the free software and open-source software?
- According to Stallman, why must we insist on free software? What are the benefits?
- Who benefits from free software, and who gets hurt?
- What is proprietary software? What is the purpose of copyright and patents, and who benefits
from them?
- What are some arguments that reject proprietary software? What does he mean when he says
that proprietary software is harmful?
- He also says that proprietary software is often malware. Give some examples to show what he
means by this.
- Do you believe that proprietary software is more harmful than helpful? Are you worried about
your privacy if you use proprietary software?
- What are the advantages of proprietary software over free software?
- If a program is available as both proprietary and free software, which one will you choose?
What if the proprietary software has more features, such as Microsoft Office versus
OpenOffice? Are you willing to pay for Microsoft Office?
- What is Service as a Software Substitute, or SaaSS? What is his opinion on SaaSS?
- How can one make money from free software? Do you think it is possible to make money?
- Do you think free software helps or hurts the software industry? Does free software discourage
innovation? Does it discourage people from choosing a career in software engineering?
- Do you support Stallman's belief that people should reject all proprietary software, or do you
support a different position?

# Answer

### February 1986 :

- The word "free" in our name does not refer to price; it refers to freedom. First, the freedom to copy a program and redistribute it to your neighbors, so that they can use it as well as you. 
- Second, the freedom to change a program, so that you can control it instead of it controlling you; for this, the source code must be made available to you.

### 1996:

- The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

### Comparison with open source

The term “open source” software is used by some people to mean more or less the same category as free software. It is not exactly the same class of software: they accept some licences that we consider too restrictive, and there are free software licences they have not accepted. However, the differences in extension of the category are small: nearly all free software is open source, and nearly all open source software is free.

### What we can benefit?

1) Available at minimal cost
Free software does not mean zero cost software. It is true that most current open source projects are available for free of cost, which leads ambiguity around the commonly used term "free software." So the common saying is, "Think free as in free speech (freedom) and not free as in free beer (zero cost)." Free software lowers the production cost. Making a system like MS-Windows costs millions of dollars. But if you produce the same kind of system using a free POSIX version, it would probably cost less than a hundred dollars.

2) Provides full freedom
Originally, computer manufacturers aimed only for hardware innovation and didn't consider software as a business asset. This is because most computer users were scientists and technicians who could modify the software themselves, so hardware was distributed with the software pre-installed. Later, high level programming languages were introduced which were compatible for almost every kind of computer. That meant even less efficient hardware design could be made to work better. This led to a decline in profit margin for hardware manufacturers who led design innovations and considered hardware as their only business assets. They had to start treating software as an essential part of their hardware sales, enforcing strict copyright policies. This led to the rise of proprietary software.

Richard Stallman once said:

"The first step in using a computer was to promise not to help your neighbor. A cooperating community was forbidden. The rule made by the owners of proprietary software was, 'If you share with your neighbor, you are a pirate. If you want any changes, beg us to make them.'"
Free software gives users the freedom to study how the program works by accessing the source code, writing additional code, testing, modifying and distributing it. These things are prohibited for proprietary software.

3) No imposed upgrades
Free software never disappears like proprietary. If proprietary vendors stop supporting a product, users have two options: either use an unsupported version of the software, or go for an (unwanted) upgrade. Imposed upgrading never happens for free software. For example when RedHat decided to stop supporting their RedHat Linux 7, 8, and 9, various other companies came forward to support them.

4) No spying on users
If users have no control over the software they are using, it can easily spy on their activity. The company behind proprietary software often installs features that restrict users from sharing it with others. Since anyone who buys proprietary software must sign a licensing agreement before using it, they are agreeing that the vendor has the right to inspect hard drive content without warning. This violates our privacy because our computers hold our personal information and daily activities.

5) Auditability
When closed-source software manufacturers claim that they made improvements in the program, improved security and restricted backdoors, users are forced to believe it. Since the source code is not provided, there is no evidence for such claims.

6) Provides better security
It is a commonly known fact that proprietary software threatens users' security. There is a long history of security vulnerabilities. Proprietary software doesn't necessarily stop the spreading of viruses and letting hackers to take over people's computers for sending spam. Because the software is secret, all users are dependent on the corporation to fix these kinds of problems.

7) No monopolies
It is easier and cheaper to switch from one free software to another compared to switching proprietary software. Free software does not tie you down to any corporation.

8) Truly user-oriented
One of proprietary software's major claims is that free software is not user-oriented. A proprietary vendor used to listen to its customers' needs and respond and develop accordingly. But companies like Red Hat and IBM are crafting strategies that rely on all end users having the same needs.

9) No lock-in standards
Proprietary vendors lock-in proprietary standards to ensure that their users will become returning customers. Free software works in open standards.

10) Part of social movement
Free software is not just for the individual user's sake. It promotes social solidarity and represents society as a whole through sharing and cooperation. Since our activities are progressively digitized, free software is becoming an even more essential part of our culture and life activities.
