# Question
Richard Stallman, the founder of the GNU Project, supports “free” software and believes that
proprietary software (like Microsoft Windows) is harmful. Do you agree with his views? In your
editorial, please include answers to the following questions. For questions that ask for your opinion,
please explain your reasoning.

- What is the free software movement? What does Richard Stallman mean by “free”? Does he
mean that people should not charge money for software, or does “free” have a different
meaning?
- What are the four essential freedoms of free software?
- What is the difference between the free software and open-source software?
- According to Stallman, why must we insist on free software? What are the benefits?
- Who benefits from free software, and who gets hurt?
- What is proprietary software? What is the purpose of copyright and patents, and who benefits
from them?
- What are some arguments that reject proprietary software? What does he mean when he says
that proprietary software is harmful?
- He also says that proprietary software is often malware. Give some examples to show what he
means by this.
- Do you believe that proprietary software is more harmful than helpful? Are you worried about
your privacy if you use proprietary software?
- What are the advantages of proprietary software over free software?
- If a program is available as both proprietary and free software, which one will you choose?
What if the proprietary software has more features, such as Microsoft Office versus
OpenOffice? Are you willing to pay for Microsoft Office?
- What is Service as a Software Substitute, or SaaSS? What is his opinion on SaaSS?
- How can one make money from free software? Do you think it is possible to make money?
- Do you think free software helps or hurts the software industry? Does free software discourage
innovation? Does it discourage people from choosing a career in software engineering?
- Do you support Stallman's belief that people should reject all proprietary software, or do you
support a different position?

# Answer

### February 1986 :

- The word "free" in our name does not refer to price; it refers to freedom. First, the freedom to copy a program and redistribute it to your neighbors, so that they can use it as well as you. 
- Second, the freedom to change a program, so that you can control it instead of it controlling you; for this, the source code must be made available to you.

### 1996:

- The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

### Comparison with open source

The term “open source” software is used by some people to mean more or less the same category as free software. It is not exactly the same class of software: they accept some licences that we consider too restrictive, and there are free software licences they have not accepted. However, the differences in extension of the category are small: nearly all free software is open source, and nearly all open source software is free.
